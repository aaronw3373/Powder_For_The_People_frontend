#Powder For The People

thepowderpeople.com

backend repo: https://github.com/aaronw3373/project_2_backend

#Explanation
My app compares ski resorts.
It uses ski resort statistics, current weather information,
and distance calculation to help users determine where to go skiing.
Users can log in to save their favorite resorts.
and users can search by name in the search bar for resorts.

#Powder Index
I came up with a algorithm/function which takes in all the data points and outputs a single number I call the Powder Index which is used to compare resorts.

#Bugs
There is a bug in deleting users that I think is related to dependecies issues with favorites. (In progress)

I need more backend validations to even more safely allow only admin to do CRUD tasks on resorts and users
